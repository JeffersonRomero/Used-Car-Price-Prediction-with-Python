# Used-Car-Price-Prediction-with-Python

# Description:
This personal Data Science project involves predicting used car prices using Python, leveraging libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and Scikit-learn. The focus is on data collection, cleaning, and exploration, utilizing these tools to build and evaluate multiple regression models, including Multiple Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression. By incorporating statistical analysis the project aims to demonstrate practical data science skills, such as handling complex datasets and developing predictive models in a real-world context.

# Description of the Files:

1. **auto.csv:** This file contains the raw data initially downloaded for the project. It represents the unprocessed dataset that forms the basis for subsequent analysis and transformations.
2. **automobile.csv:** This file is an enhanced version of the raw data with added headers and other modifications to facilitate exploratory data analysis. It provides a more structured format for examining the data.

3. **clean_df.csv:** This is the final dataset, which includes additional columns and other adjustments made during the data cleaning process. It is the dataset used for in-depth analysis and modeling.

4. **Price_Prediction_Python.ipynb:** This Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code and documentation used for predicting vehicle prices. It includes detailed explanations of the methods and processes employed throughout the analysis.

5. **Price_Prediction_Python.py:** This is the Python script version of the notebook mentioned above. It contains the same code as the notebook but in a script format, suitable for running in various Python environments.

6. **Price_Prediction_Python.pdf:** This PDF document provides a static view of the Jupyter Notebook, capturing the code and explanations as they appear in the notebook format. It serves as a reference for understanding the analysis workflow and methodologies used.

7. **Price_Prediction_Report.pdf:** This PDF report offers a comprehensive overview of the project. It includes sections such as introduction, methodology, analysis, conclusions, and appendices. It provides a detailed explanation of the projectâ€™s objectives, the methods used, the insights gained, and the overall outcomes of the price prediction analysis.
